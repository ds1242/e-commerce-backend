  # E-Commerce-Backend 

  ## About/Description

  This project was to setup the backend for an E-commerce website.  It required the use of dotenv, express, mysql2, and sequelize to generate the relationships and store data in the database.  Sequelize used the routes and the required methods to run SQL queries and modify the data seeded into the database.
